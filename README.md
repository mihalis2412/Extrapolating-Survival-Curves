# Extrapolating-Survival-Curves
Investigation of techniques for survival extrapolation using suitable richly parametric &amp; semi-parametric methods for time to event data. 

# Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from [add dataset source here]. It contains clinical information about breast cancer patients, including demographic details, tumor characteristics, treatment history, and survival outcomes. The dataset comprises both numerical and categorical variables, providing a comprehensive view of patients' health status and disease progression.

# Code Structure

The code is written in R programming language and organized into several sections:

# Data Preprocessing: 
Reads the raw dataset, handles missing values, converts data types, and preprocesses variables for analysis.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Visualizes the distribution of variables, explores relationships between predictors, and conducts statistical tests to identify associations.

# Survival Analysis: 
Utilizes Kaplan-Meier estimator to model overall survival, assesses the impact of various factors on survival outcomes, and identifies significant predictors using statistical tests such as Chi-Squared, Fisher's Exact Test, and Spearman Rank Correlation.

# Visualization: 
Generates visualizations including Kaplan-Meier plots, bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and heatmaps to gain insights into the data and present findings.

# README File: 
Provides an overview of the project, dataset, code structure, and instructions for running the analysis.
